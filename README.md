# RxJS Core Meeting Notes

RxJS Core team meets once every two weeks to discuss the development of RxJS, future plans, and priorities.

New notes will be added as pull requests so you will be notified of them if you watch the repo. You can comment on the pull requests to discuss the notes, or raise issues if you would like to ask for a clarification. Please direct other support and "how do I?" questions to [StackOverflow](stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/rxjs).

The repo format is inspired by [Ember](https://github.com/emberjs/core-notes) and [React's](https://github.com/reactjs/core-notes) Core Notes.
